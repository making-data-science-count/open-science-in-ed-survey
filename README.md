## Construct - Open Science Practices

Wondering about studying these constructs as *open science practices*:

-Preregistration
-Open Materials and/or Code
-Open Data
-Pre-publication Archiving
-Open Access Publishing  

These are highlighted in a survey of the open science practices that researchers at an Australian University participate in (Kaufman et al., 2019): https://osf.io/a4bwp/.

They are also similar to those described in [van der Zee and Reich (2018)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2332858418787466), e.g.., "each aspect of the scientific cycle ... 

- research design (open design and pre-registration)
- data collection (open data)
- analysis, and (open analyses, i.e., sharing code)
- publication (open access)

... can and should be made more transparent and accessible"

## Study Plan

1. Decide on constructs to study; 
   1. are the five from Kaufman et al. (2019) inclusive enough?
   1. b) those that are relevant and important to educational researchers?
1. Create the survey (using Qualtrics? or some OSS? :))
1. Pilot test/receive feedback
1. Determine who we send it to; reach out to AERA's executive director about possibly surveying AERA members
