## Need for study 

- Identify aspects of open science that are most- and least-practiced (and reasons one)
- Have initial data to compare efforts to support open science practices over time
- Despite interest in and notions about the progress of open science in education, no empirical data is available

## Construct - open science practices

Wondering about studying these constructs as *open science practices*:

-Preregistration . 
-Open Materials and/or Code . 
-Open Data . 
-Pre-publication Archiving . 
-Open Access Publishing . 

These are highlighted in a survey of the open science practices that researchers at an Australian University participate in (Kaufman et al., 2019): https://osf.io/a4bwp/.

They are also similar to those described in [van der Zee and Reich (2018)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2332858418787466), e.g.., "each aspect of the scientific cycle ... 

- research design (open design and pre-registration)
- data collection (open data)
- analysis, and (open analyses, i.e., sharing code)
- publication (open access)

... can and should be made more transparent and accessible"

## Plan

1. Decide on constructs to study; 
   1. are the five from Kaufman et al. (2019) inclusive enough?
   1. b) those that are relevant and important to educational researchers?
1. Create the survey (using Qualtrics? or some OSS? :))
1. Pilot test/receive feedback
1. Apply for exempt IRB (with broad recruitment strategy; can revise later if a specific population is recruited to participate)
1. Determine who we send it to; reach out to AERA's executive director about possibly surveying AERA members
